This is a plugin for controlling your vim editor by starting a Python server inside it until you quit vim. This is an alternative to "vim -servername", which I could not use on a terminal only environment. Also, does not need a X-server.

Whit VimPyServer you can:

- Integrate your Cygwin-based Vim editor with Windows Explorer and edit every file on a single vim instance!

- Send commands to you current open vim editor from another terminal, even from another computer!

- Remotely control your current open vim editor, integrate it on an IDE automate actions!
