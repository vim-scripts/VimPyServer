1. Intro                                      *VimPyServer-intro* 

This is a plugin to remote control your vim editor by starting a Python server
inside it until you quit vim. This is an alternative to "vim -servername", 
which I could not use on a terminal only environment. It is expected
to be faster and with less memory footprint than the X-server
version. 

Whit VimPyServer you can:

* Integrate the edition of every file on your computer (Windows explorer, 
  Firefox, mutt, etc) on a single instance of Vim editor (cygwin based or not). 
  No more copy-paste hell, no more vim editors open everywhere! 
  See the README.asciidoc to examples of:

    ** Defaulting single Cygwin Vim instance with Windows Explorer "Open with"
    ** Single Vim instance for Firefox + Vimperator
    ** Single Vim instance for mutt (coming soon!)

* Have fun messing the code of your friends in their faces!

    ** Chat with VimPyServer inside vim and share snippets of code with your 
  buddies, easier than ever! - see the README.asciidoc

* Send commands to you current open vim editor from another terminal, 
  even from another computer! 
* Remotely control your current open vim editor, integrate it on an IDE
  automate actions!


=============================================================================
2. Requirements                               *VimPyServer-requirements* 

- VIM 7.4 with python and python3 (check it with vim --version)
- Python 2.7.8 (Should work on Python 3. Please send me a message if you
  test it with version 3.
- for the time being, netcat (nc) is required. Future versions won't need
  it.

=============================================================================
3. Installation                               *VimPyServer-installation* 

- Clone it to your .vim/bundle:
  
  git clone https://github.com/degyves/VimPyServer.git

- Set your environment variables and restart your terminals:

** Under Windows: add VIMPYSERVER_HOME to your environment variables 
  (WIN+Pause, advanced settings). The value will be the path, in Windows format,
   of where you have cloned VimPyServer. Also add %VIMPYSERVER_HOME%\bin to your
  Windows PATH. Do not configure these variables on `~/.bashrc`.
** Under Linux/Mac: add VIMPYSERVER_HOME to your `~/.bashrc`. The value will
  be the path where you have cloned VimPyServer. Also add $VIMPYSERVER_HOME\bin
  to your PATH.
** Under OpenBSD: add VIMPYSERVER_HOME to your `~/.profile`. The value will
  be the path where you have cloned VimPyServer. Also add $VIMPYSERVER_HOME\bin
  to your PATH.

- That's it!* VimPyServer will own the first vim editor you use.
  If you open several vim editors, only the first one will be controlled
  by the VimPyServer. This will be changed later so any vim editor will have
  its own VimPyServer.

=============================================================================
4. Usage                                      *VimPyServer-usage* 

You can send only one command per time. VimPyServer will remove spaces,
newlines and tabs from the beginning and end of the command.

- Send a command from another terminal to your vim editor, 
  controlled by VimPyServer. This will open ~/.bashrc.

  $ echo "e ~/.bashrc" | nc localhost 9876

- Turn off VimPyServer:

  :call CloseVimPyServer()

- Turn on VimPyServer:

  :call OpenVimPyServer()

=============================================================================
5. Configuration                              *VimPyServer-configuration* 

The following variables can be set on your ~/.vimrc:

- Set this to disable the automatic start of VimPyServer:

  let g:VimPyServer_autostart=0

- Set this to change the default port (9876 by default). It must be an integer:

  let g:VimPyServer_port=9876

- Set this to change the default host ('127.0.0.1' by default). Must be string:
